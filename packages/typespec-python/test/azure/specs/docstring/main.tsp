An array of tools the model may call while generating a response.
You can specify which tool to use by setting the `tool_choice` parameter.

The two categories of tools you can provide the model are:

* **Built-in tools**: Tools that are provided by OpenAI that extend the model's capabilities, like file search.
* **Function calls (custom tools)**: Functions that are defined by you, enabling the model to call your own code.

Specifies the processing type used for serving the request.
* If set to 'auto', then the request will be processed with the service tier configured in the Project settings. Unless otherwise configured, the Project will use 'default'.
* If set to 'default', then the request will be processed with the standard pricing and performance for the selected model.
* If set to '[flex](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/flex-processing)' or 'priority', then the request will be processed with the corresponding service tier. [Contact sales](https://openai.com/contact-sales) to learn more about Priority processing.
* When not set, the default behavior is 'auto'.

When the `service_tier` parameter is set, the response body will include the `service_tier`
value based on the processing mode actually used to serve the request. This response value
may be different from the value set in the parameter.
